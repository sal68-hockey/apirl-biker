                <h2>Who They Were</h2>
                <p>The Hells Angels Motorcycle Club, formed in the late 1940s, became iconic in the 1960s as an outlaw
                    biker group known for their rebellious lifestyle, close brotherhood, and anti-establishment
                    attitude.</p>

                <h2>What They Did</h2>
                <p>Throughout the 60s, the Hells Angels gained notoriety for their rowdy rides, parties, clashes with
                    law enforcement, and their presence at events like the Rolling Stones concert at Altamont in 1969.
                    They lived on the edge of the law, often accused of violence and criminal activity.</p>

                    and bandanas. Their clothing symbolized their loyalty and defiance, with the iconic winged skull
