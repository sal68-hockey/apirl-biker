            <h2>The 1950s: Origins & Identity</h2>

            <p>The Hells Angels Motorcycle Club (HAMC) was founded in 1948 in Fontana, California. During the 1950s, the
                club expanded throughout California, establishing a reputation for defiance and camaraderie. Members
                were known for riding Harley-Davidson motorcycles, often acquired from police auctions and meticulously
                rebuilt.</p>
            <p>The club's image was shaped by media portrayals, notably the 1947 Hollister riot, which inspired the film
                <em>The Wild One</em>. This era marked the beginning of the "one-percenter" identity, distinguishing
                outlaw bikers from the mainstream motorcycling community.

            <h2>The 1960s: Expansion & Infamy</h2>

            <p>The 1960s saw the Hells Angels' expansion beyond California, including the establishment of international
                chapters, such as in New Zealand in 1961. Their notoriety grew due to high-profile incidents and a
                rebellious image that both fascinated and alarmed the public.</p>
            <p>A significant event was the Altamont Free Concert in 1969, where the Hells Angels provided security. The
                event turned tragic with the death of a concertgoer, highlighting the club's volatile reputation.</p>
