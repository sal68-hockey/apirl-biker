            <img src="images/50s-image.jpg" alt="1950s Hells Angels" class="section-img">
            <p>The 1950s were the formative years of the Hells Angels, a time when they crafted their identity as a
                rebellious group. Their motorcycles became a symbol of freedom, and they positioned themselves in
                opposition to the constraints of American society, standing as an anti-authority symbol.</p>
            <p>The first chapters formed in California, and their influence started to spread throughout the United
                States. This was the decade that set the stage for their future dominance in the motorcycle scene.</p>

            <img src="images/60s-image.jpg" alt="1960s Hells Angels" class="section-img">
            <p>During the 1960s, the Hells Angels rose to national infamy. They became the face of rebellious
                counterculture. By 1969, their involvement in the Altamont Free Concert solidified their infamous
                reputation.</p>
            <p>By the late 60s, their brand of outlaw culture had a massive influence on the hippie movement, even
                though the two groups clashed ideologically. Their reach extended beyond California, marking them as one
                of the most recognizable motorcycle clubs in the world.</p>
